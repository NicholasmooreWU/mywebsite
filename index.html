    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nicholas Moore, I am a Computer Science Data Science double major at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon.
      I have a passion for cryptography and data analysis. I have a special passion for working with sports data, and I love to find trends to help
      Athletes and teams improve their performance. I have a strong background in SQL, Python, and R, and I am always looking to learn new skills and technologies.
      I am currently looking for internships and job opportunities in the field of data science and analysis. I am particularly interested in roles that involve
      working with large datasets and using data to drive decision-making. 

      Despite being in a major that often involves sitting at a computer for extended periods, I love to do work with my hands as well such as working with cars. I also on the swim
      team and work part time at Willamette so I am no stranger to 70-80 hour works weeks at times during the year with all the different activites going on.

      <li>Minecraft Data Analysis: This project included data colection taking observations from the first 30 minutes of a game of minecraft in order to determin what events happend
        inside of the game.

      </li>
      <li>Soccer Data Analysis: This project worked with analyzing differnt soccer information and  trying to determin if there was a optimal way to play the game.
