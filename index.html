  <section id="about me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nicholas Moore, and I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Data Science at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon. I am passionate about cryptography and data analysis, focusing on sports analyticsâ€”leveraging data to uncover trends that help athletes and teams elevate their performance.

I bring a strong foundation in SQL, Python, and R, and I am continually expanding my skill set by learning new tools and technologies. I am actively seeking internships and full-time opportunities in data science and analysis, particularly roles that involve working with large-scale datasets and driving decision-making through data insights.

Outside the classroom, I enjoy hands-on work such as working on cars in my garage. As a dedicated member of the Willamette swim team and a part-time campus employee, I am accustomed to demanding schedules and have honed my discipline and time-management skills by balancing 70 - 80 hour work weeks during the academic year.

      <li>Stock Market Data Management: This project used SQL to compile multiple tables together, changing formatting to create one massive table containing all 
        the data from the stock market. This project was done in order to analyze the stock market and find trends in the data.
