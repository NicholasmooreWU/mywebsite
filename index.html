    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nicholas Moore, I am a Computer Science Data Science double major at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon.
      I have a passion for cryptography and data analysis. I have a special passion for working with sports data, and I love to find trends to help
      Athletes and teams improve their performance. I have a strong background in SQL, Python, and R, and I am always looking to learn new skills and technologies.
      I am currently looking for internships and job opportunities in the field of data science and analysis. I am particularly interested in roles that involve
      working with large datasets and using data to drive decision-making.
